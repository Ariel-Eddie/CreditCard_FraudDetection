The actual database is highly imbalanced and include 30 features variables and 1 target variable.
28 of the features variables are anonymised.

The project contain 3 notbooks :
- data_explo for exploration and some visualisations
- MLdetection for models creation : 3 models have been selected - Logistic Regression , Random Forest and SVM (in the first version)
- Interpretability to check the most influencial variables on the classifier decision
